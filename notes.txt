the goal is to build a microservice to handle transcription of audio.
we will use python for this
users will upload an audio file and then we will add this to a queue
every 15 mintutes we will find a new item in the queue and handle the transcription.
for optimizations we can run multiple threads and have them process the audio on its own

we will store the audio/video files in an S3 bucket
we will manage our queue using postgres
once files are transcribed we will delete the file and save the transcript and srt file to postgres
